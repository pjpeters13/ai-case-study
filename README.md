Company: AI Squared

Incorporated: 2019

The founder of the company? Benjamin Harvey

How did the idea for the company come about? 
Benjamin was inspired to start the company after a decade at the U.S. National Security Agency, where he saw how it and other organizations struggled to adopt artificial intelligence into existing applications.

How is the company funded? Seed
How much funding have they received? 6 million Dollars.

Business Activities
What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

AI Squared helps solve the last-mile problem, like Netflix’s program recommender system, 
assisting companies in adopting AI by using a low-code platform to integrate it into existing applications. 

Who is the company's intended customer?   
Financial Services, Government, and Health Life Sciences

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? 
(What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
They solved the “last mile problem”. Through a combination of pruning, quantization, and NAS, they reduce the resources to run neural networks by up to 90% without reducing performance. They simplify the integration of ML by enabling their optimized model format to run directly within the browser through drag-and-drop model integration, minimal code required.

Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?     
They are using a model architecture they created called “Multitask Artificial Neural Network (MANN, for short)”, This model combines the biologically inspired structure with recent advancements in sparse neural network architectures to yield models capable of addressing the most pressing shortcomings of state-of-the-art ML. The model creates drag and drop technology for machine learning.

What are the other major companies in this field?

The following two companies are direct competitors as far as services are concerned, with Predibase offering more services. However, AI Squared is on top of the newest innovators list.

Predibase
Noogata

What has been the business impact of this company so far? 
A-Squared can inject model results into your favorite web applications to unlock powerful predictive and generative AI-generated insights, instantly. It can 
provide predictive and generative AI-powered insights within the web apps that your business teams use the most, without going through traditional, time-consuming development cycles.

The recommendation I would give would be to work on deep neural networks to allow the many uses of robotics. One such case is Reinforcement Learning (RL):
Reinforcement learning, which is powered by deep neural networks, has been used to train robots to perform tasks through trial and error. This has applications in areas such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and game-playing robots.
